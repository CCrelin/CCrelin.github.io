I have always been captivated by technology and the "idea" of programming. I built my first PC when I was 14, and never looked back. When I began gaming, browsing the web, and connecting with people from across the world, it was an amazing experience.  For a long time, I avoided going into a tech field because my computer has always been a place where I go to destress and find peace. I feared my peace would turn to chaos if I chose to mix a hobby with work. It took years of maturing and working passionless jobs for me to realize that my fear is irrational and just an excuse, so here I am now. I start my journey a bit late, with minimal experience, but with a passion and excitement I have not felt for a long time.
